Javascript variables are like containers where you can store data that can be
used and manipulated throughout.Variables in Javascript are used to store data,
values or references to data.

They are created using the var, let or const keyword, and each of these has its own
scope and use case.


var:
The var is mostly used in older code base.Each function scoped and can be redeclared
and updated.

It was introduced in ES6.It is a block scope and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
